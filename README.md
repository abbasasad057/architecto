### A Three.js-based Building Planner

Architecto is a React-based building planning application that leverages the power of Three.js for 3D modeling and visualization. With Architecto, you can create, visualize, and modify building structures in a 3D environment, all within an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **3D Building Modeling**: Use the Three.js engine to design and manipulate building structures in real-time.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily place walls, windows, doors, and other building components.
- **Live Preview**: See your updates reflected in real-time as you edit your building plans.
- **Customization**: Modify dimensions, textures, and materials to achieve your desired look.
- **Export & Save**: Export your 3D building models in common formats like GLTF or OBJ for use in other applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React**: The user interface is built with React, providing a smooth and modular structure for components.
- **Three.js**: Three.js handles the 3D rendering, allowing for real-time building visualization.
- **Styled-Components**: For modular and maintainable styles.
- **Axios**: Used for API requests, if applicable.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, making it easier to work with 3D in React.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started with Architecto, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abbasasad057/architecto.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd architecto
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚ú® Usage

Once the project is up and running, you can start building your architectural models by interacting with the UI elements:

1. **Navigation**: Use the mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan around the 3D scene.
2. **Placing Objects**: Drag and drop building elements like walls, windows, and floors into the scene.
3. **Modifying Objects**: Click on any object to modify its properties (e.g., size, position, texture).
4. **Saving/Exporting**: Save your progress and export your models to standard 3D formats.
